K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The core idea of KNN is that an instance’s label (or value, in the case of regression) can be determined by looking at the “labels” of its closest neighbors in the feature space.
